    <!--Instead of commenting every place I made changes, I am giving a brief on what I have changed. Because, commenting every line makes the submission really messy.
        Firstly, in navbar, I have introducced a hamburger button to store all the navigation lists which was not done in the previous task. Inside the hamburger, I have also introduced a dropdown option for the page contents
        On the right hand side, I have introduced an off canvas - About, which says some information about me and a few lines about the contents in this page
        The next major change is the Beautiful stadiums cards. I have divided the page equally - 6 columns per card and then added images and content to it.
        In the same cards, I have introduced collapse - Know more. By clicking this, the user can get more information about the respective stadiums.
        Throughout this task, I made sure this website is responsive in all screen sizes-->

            <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two
                teams
                of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a
                pitch.
                The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the
                goal
                line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been
                played
                over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players
                active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.</p>
            <p>The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that
                has
                been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that
                is
                68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal
                (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players
                mainly
                use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control,
                strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the
                penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the
                format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, or the
                game
                goes into extra time or a penalty shootout.</p>
            <p>Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental
                confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA. Of these confederations, CONMEBOL is the
                oldest
                one, being founded in 1916. National associations (e.g. The FA or JFA) are responsible for managing the
                game
                in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in
                accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the
                FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in
                the
                world, surpassing the Olympic Games.[6] The two most prestigious competitions in European club football
                are
                the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which attract an extensive television
                audience throughout the world. Since 2009, the final of the men's tournament has been the most-watched
                annual sporting event in the world.</p>
